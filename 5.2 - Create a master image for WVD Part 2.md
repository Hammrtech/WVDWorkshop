[![Navigate to the Windows start menu and reboot the Windows 10 VM.](file:///C:/Users/MARKMC~1/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image005.png)](https://github.com/neilsly/MCW-Implementing-Windows-Virtual-Desktop-in-the-enterprise/blob/main/Hands-on lab/images/win10reboot.png)

### Task 4: Run Sysprep

\1.   After the VM has rebooted, reconnect your RDP session and sign in.

\2.   Open an administrative command prompt.

\3.   Navigate to: **C:\Windows\System32\Sysprep**.

```
4.  cd C:\Windows\System32\Sysprep
```

\5.   Run the following command to sysprep the VM and shutdown:

```
6.  sysprep.exe /oobe /generalize /shutdown
```

The system will automatically shut down and disconnect your RDP session.

### Task 5: Create a managed image from the Master Image VM

\1.   Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

\2.   At the top of the page, in the **Search resources** field, type **virtual machines**. Select **Virtual machines** from the list.

[![From the Azure portal search bar, search for virtual machines and select the service.](file:///C:/Users/MARKMC~1/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image006.png)](https://github.com/neilsly/MCW-Implementing-Windows-Virtual-Desktop-in-the-enterprise/blob/main/Hands-on lab/images/searchvm.png)

\3.   On the Virtual machines blade, locate the VM you used for your master image and **Select** on the name.

\4.   On the Overview blade for your VM, confirm the **Status** shows **Stopped**. Select **Stop** in the menu bar to move it to a deallocated state.

[![This is what you will see if the VM is running.  Please select stop to deallocate the VM.](file:///C:/Users/MARKMC~1/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image008.png)](https://github.com/neilsly/MCW-Implementing-Windows-Virtual-Desktop-in-the-enterprise/blob/main/Hands-on lab/images/vmrunning.png)

[![When the VM has been stopped, it will show the status of stopped, deallocated.](file:///C:/Users/MARKMC~1/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image010.png)](https://github.com/neilsly/MCW-Implementing-Windows-Virtual-Desktop-in-the-enterprise/blob/main/Hands-on lab/images/vmstopped.png)

\5.   Once complete, Select **Capture** in the menu bar.

[![Once the VM is stopped, you can select capture to capture the VM image.](file:///C:/Users/MARKMC~1/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image012.png)](https://github.com/neilsly/MCW-Implementing-Windows-Virtual-Desktop-in-the-enterprise/blob/main/Hands-on lab/images/vmcapture.png)

\6.   On the Create image blade, fill in the required fields and Select **Create**.

[![This will display the Create Image blade in Azure.](file:///C:/Users/MARKMC~1/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image014.png)](https://github.com/neilsly/MCW-Implementing-Windows-Virtual-Desktop-in-the-enterprise/blob/main/Hands-on lab/images/w10VMImage.png)

\7.   Once complete, type **images** in the **Search resources field** at the top of the page. Select **Images** from the list.

\8.   On the Images blade, locate your image and **Select** on the name.

[![When you search on images, this is the icon that you will need to select.](file:///C:/Users/MARKMC~1/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image015.png)](https://github.com/neilsly/MCW-Implementing-Windows-Virtual-Desktop-in-the-enterprise/blob/main/Hands-on lab/images/findimage.png)

\9.   On the Overview blade for your image, make note of the **Name** field and **Resource group** field. These attributes are needed when you provision your host pools.

[![This is the information that you need to note for the name and resource group.](file:///C:/Users/MARKMC~1/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image017.png)](https://github.com/neilsly/MCW-Implementing-Windows-Virtual-Desktop-in-the-enterprise/blob/main/Hands-on lab/images/newimage.png)

### Task 6: Provision a Host Pool with a custom image

\1.   To start provisioning a host pool with your custom image, follow the instructions in [Exercise 6](https://github.com/neilsly/MCW-Implementing-Windows-Virtual-Desktop-in-the-enterprise/blob/main/Hands-on lab/HOL step-by-step - Implementing Windows Virtual Desktop in the enterprise.md#exercise-6-create-a-host-pool-and-assign-pooled-remote-apps).

\2.   When you get to step 5 to configure **Virtual machine settings**, select **Browse all images and disks** and then select the tab option for **My Items** to select the image that was created.

[![This is where you will find your custom image to add to the host pool.](file:///C:/Users/MARKMC~1/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image019.png)](https://github.com/neilsly/MCW-Implementing-Windows-Virtual-Desktop-in-the-enterprise/blob/main/Hands-on lab/images/hostpoolcustom.png)
